Introduction

This is calculator app developed in python language.
using math operators , variables, conditional statements, functions and handle user input to make our calculator.

Step 1: Adding operators

Before our program is complete ,we'll add a total of 4 mathematical operators: + for addition,- for subtraction,
* for multiplication, / for Division. as we added the remaining operators -,*,/,+ into the program above.

Step 2: Adding conditional statements

We are using each of the operators symbols for users to make their choice,
so if user want any operation like addition to be performed they will type indicated number 1 and symbol '+',
they will type number form one to four.We could choose whatever symbols we want, though,
like 1 for addition or 2 for subtraction.Because we are asking users for input ,we want to use the input() function.

Step 3: Users for Input prompt

we shall use python built-in input() function that accepts user generated input from the keyboard.
inside the parantheses of the input() function we pass the string .

Step 4: Defining functions

The ability perform the program as many times as the user wnats, we'll define some functions.
we'll name the function calculator() and add an additional layer of indentation within the function itself.
Next , we want to give the user the choice as to whether they want to calculate or not.but in this case only have
one if , one elif,and one else conditional statement use.
